## Open Source Philosophy

This project follows an open-first philosophy. The open-source version you see
here is fully functional and valuable for standard use cases.

Files marked with `*.open.*` indicate that enhanced versions are available in
our premium offering. These enhancements provide additional optimizations,
advanced features, or performance improvements while the open versions remain
completely usable.

For more information about premium features, please contact giuseppe.doppiaggi@gmail.com.
